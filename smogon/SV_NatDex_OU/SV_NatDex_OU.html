                Today I made the team with a different approach: instead of starting with only one mon to build around, I chose a core that performed well in NDPL: Ogerpon+Gholdengo. Ogerpon is the usual SD set, with Superpower
                to hit Ferrothorn. Gholdengo adds a good defensive profile and can switch into Kyurem, Lele and other fast special attackers. There is not really much to say of this team, every set is standard. I'm not particulary
                satisfied from the result, because, even though it performed decently, the result is a much more bulkier and slower than originally intended. The goal for the day was to make an offense team, and this clearly isn't. <br>

                was that it took me too much time to figure out the path to win and by that time I conceded too much.

                Happy New Year to everyone reading this. I did not have anything particular in mind to start off the year, so I decided to get inspired by NDCL replays. This replay
                <b> <a href="https://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/smogtours-gen9nationaldex-895904" style="color:rgb(1, 209, 70)">[R]</a></b> from Metallica126 really surprised me: on turn 5, Volcanion reveals
                Fire Spin to trap Alomomola, which was prevented from switching because of Water Absorb. Moving to the teambuilder, I started thinking about similar strategies: first I lookep up Ghost mons that could learn 
                a trapping move and curse, but the most valid option was unfortunately Skeledirge. Looking around, I found that Altaria runs a PerishTrap set in SVNU, which could be changed for a MegaAltaria and used in NDOU. <br>
                The first version I used was PerishSong+FireSpin+Roost+Defog, but it revealed itself too passive so I swapped Defog for Return, which performed way better. The rest of the team is a basic defensive core, scarf Lando,
                Raging Bolt for priority and Cinderace for hazard control. Cinderace initially was Blaze and had WillOWisp instead of High Jump Kick, but it also revealed too passive so it was changed; Raging Bolt used to be Draco instead
                of Dragon Pulse, but the SpA drop limited RagingBolt made games too prediction reliant. Toxic Spikes and Future Sight on Slowking really help moving the game forward, while Mola is a generic cleric support set. <br>
                Overall, the team performed decently on ladder, starting from low 1500 and moving up to 1680, but ended up mostly hovering between 1600 and 1650. Altaria was very hit or miss: there were games in which it was essential to break 
                the defensive core, and games in which it ended up being nothing but a sac: it turns out, a lot of the mons that Altaria would like to take down either beat it 1v1 or can just pivot out, with Slowking Galar being the worst possible matchup.
                A Gholdengo would fix a lot of matchups for this team, but it doesn't really fit in the team, since Lando is a better scarfer and ground immunity while Raging Bolt can be a good defensive piece, especially against OgerponWellspring. <br>
                <b> <a href="./Replays/TeamBuildJanuary/Gen9NationalDex-2026-01-02-syntheticaperture-nicholasdousa.html" style="color:rgb(1, 209, 70)">[R1]</a></b> This replays shows off what the team is supposed to do: Altaria is immediately able to remove
                an unsuspecting Garganacl, which removes the most annoying defensive piece and the hazard setting mon. After that, the game is straight-forward, and on turn 20 Altaria prevents a IDef Zamazenta setting up with PerishSong. <br>
                <b> <a href="./Replays/TeamBuildJanuary/Gen9NationalDex-2026-01-02-syntheticaperture-sknky.html" style="color:rgb(1, 209, 70)">[R2]</a></b> In this game Altaria is completely useless, but it shows how the rest of the team can hold its own
                even without the main strategy.

                A special team for a special day. I wanted to make a team centered around a strong special attacker, so I looked up "Nasty Plot" in the teambuilder and Lando-T 
                popped out. I was familiar with special lando, but I had never tought about using Nasty Plot on it. Grass Knot is the perfect coverage for Lando, since it usually draws in
                physdef Alomomola, which can be 1HKOed by +2 Bloom Doom if it isn't the AV set. Great Tusk is also another common switch in, which gets straight 1HKOed by Grass Knot. HP Ice is 
                for other Landorus and Gliscor, the other most common switchins. The only mon that isn't covered is Corviknight, which is not a complete wall but in practice is good enough.
                The team can surely be improved: hazards are needed so someone needs to be switched out, which I'll figure out in the next days. Still, the first version was good enough for me,
                with only minor modifications needed.

                <a href="https://pokepast.es/e500a3adbabca9ae">Dec20 - Boring Team</a><br>
                The Arcanine team did not fully satisfy me, it never felt solid to use and there were matchups which I knew would be lost from the start because I both lacked
                experience with the playstyle and confidence in my team. I took a break for a couple days, and came back to try out a new metagame, SS NatDex OU. Scrolling through
                the samples, 
                <a href="https://pokepast.es/1f6ece4de1d48616">this team</a> 
                caught my eye. In less than 30 games I reached top 500, and a few games later top 300. Most importantly, I was using a team that was able to perform well in all
                matchups. Inspired by this, I went back to SV NatDex with great hopes, and built a team with one goal only: every matchup should be playable. I put together the most
                boring team imaginable, hopped on the ladder and, after some trial and many errors, this was the outcome. <br>
                In most matchups, the team does exactly what is supposed to do: be boring and consistent. Lando sets rocks, Kyurem does most of the work with the support of Mola and Gking, Kingambit
                and Scarf Lando then clean up what is left. However, some matchups are left unaccounted. I never faced stall, but I assume it would be a 100% chance to lose every single
                game, since the team lacks a strong wall-breaker; however, stall is uncommon, so I accepted this and moved on. In the more common matchups, this team struggles to get past Ferrothorn (body press in particular)
                and Mega-Scizor (especially the Roost+SwordsDance variant), and it gets obliterated by Hoopa-Unbound. Overall the result is good, with a record of 17W/11L on ladder from 1500 up to mid 1600s. <br>
                Of all the matches, this was my favourite.

                I went with webs and picked Araquanid as a teammate, and Gholdengo came along. This team is not great, but performed half decently on high ladder, hovering between
                1730 and 1780; I really tried to break the 1800 barrier but it was too inconsistent. Overall, I'm still somewhat satisfied that I was able to use a mon not even in the VR

                I wanted to make a team with Tapu Fini for quite a while now, but I always postponed because it felt very difficult to use. After a few unsuccesful
                attempts with Primarina, I decided to start looking into it. I knew from the start that I wanted Melmetal in the team, because Misty Surge allows me to not
                worry about the birds too much. This also makes Kingambit less prediction reliant, which is something that I struggle with.
                Tapu Lele is a big problem for this team, it can break through pretty well and at minimum requires one sacrifice to take down, but a good opponent is
                not going to allow that.<br>
                Overall, I'm satisfied with the result, especially after a week-long slump: the team feels great to use and even when played improperly allows for some wiggle 
                rooom. <br>

            <a href="https://pokepast.es/ef2adef41d6cf1ca">Dec09 - Slowbro+Lopunny</a><br>
            I tried for a few days to make a team with Slowbro, but I couldn't really figure out how to use it. After some trial and error, I realized that I was struggling a lot with pursuiters (Mega-Tar and Kingambit), so I decided that Lopunny would make a good teammate, and then i started building from there. Jirachi is a shaky pick, I wanted a steel type and Jirachi was the one I believe would fit best, since it can provide Wish support that this team needs. Not the best team so far, but I really got stuck on making a Slowbro team so this is the result.</p>
